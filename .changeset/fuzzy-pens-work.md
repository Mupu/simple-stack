Modified how headers are passed to the `Response` constructor within the Astro middleware to ensure compatibility and proper operation

- Before: The response was created by passing `response.headers` directly as the second argument to `new Response(render(), response.headers)`, which was incorrect according to the expected signature of the `Response` constructor.
- After: The issue was corrected by wrapping `response.headers` in an object under the `headers` key, using the correct syntax `new Response(render(), { headers: response.headers })`. This ensures that headers are properly handled in the response generated by the middleware.
